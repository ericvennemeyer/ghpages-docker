# ghpages-docker

Docker image pegged to GitHub Pages dependencies. Designed to run a local Jekyll server that mirrors the GitHub Pages environment for development purposes. Based on [Jekyll Docker](https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker), with the resulting image hosted on my [Docker Hub account](https://hub.docker.com/repository/registry-1.docker.io/ericvennemeyer/gh-pages/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated). Written in my role as a volunteer web developer at [Hack for LA](https://www.hackforla.org/).

**NOTE:** This Dockerfile, and resulting image, are prototypes and thus not regularly maintained. For the production versions, check out Hack for LA's [ghpages-docker](https://github.com/hackforla/ghpages-docker), or pull the image from [hackforlaops/ghpages](https://hub.docker.com/r/hackforlaops/ghpages/tags) on Docker Hub.

Happy containerizing!
